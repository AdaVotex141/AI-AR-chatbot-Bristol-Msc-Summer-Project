# Introduction # 

Against the backdrop of the continuously worsen global environment, it is crucial to enhance everyone’s awareness and capability to live sustainably [reference]. Humans, particularly university students, which has intelligent and active minds, as well as hold the potential power that can drive societal change. Although most of them have been educated about environmental protection since childhood, they still encounter numerous challenges in translating their sustainable mindset into actions [reference]. For instance, they often lake simple and clear guidance on making sustainable choices. Furthermore, due to the inherent delays in educational curricula, they may not be aware of the latest environmentally friendly products available in the market. Moreover, it is struggled to balance the sustainability choice or the convince as university students in a busy campus life. Consequently, even those with strong motivation do not take significant steps towards sustainable living without proper guidance and positive feedback. As a result, the mindset remains merely conceptual, and actual sustainable actions become inefficient and challenging. As a result, the mindset reminds merely conceptual, and sustainable actions become inefficient and challenging.

Therefore, our project aims to design a web application that holds significant practical importance. It focuses on helping students enhance their sustainable mindset and assist their sustainably life whether on campus or at home.
## Motivation ##
The aim of our project is to improve the sustainable awareness among university students. Throughout the assistance of IBM AI chat bot and AR technologies, we have developed a web application designed to address the lack of proper guidance and motivation, as well as the absence of positive feedback, which are critical in fostering sustainable habits. The application will assist students make choices that prioritize sustainability. Furthermore, it includes a reward system that encourages students to take pride in protecting the environment, helping them to smoothly adopt sustainable habits by completing environmentally friendly tasks routinely. As a vital segment of society, university students' embrace of sustainable living will have a widespread impact, promoting sustainable practices across the campus and encouraging students to take concrete actions. In the long term, this initiative will positively influence the overall sustainable awareness of society, contributing significantly to global sustainability.
## Aims and Objectives ##
This project focuses on launching website application called Glife. The primary goal of Glife is to assist university students and other individuals in adopting more sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle by utilizing the application on computers or mobile devices. Ultimately, the aim is to contribute to global sustainability efforts.
For achieving this aim, the project has several specific objectives. Firstly, the implementation, testing, evaluation and writing of this web application needing to be completed within three months. Secondly, this web application is designed into three different primary functions finally:
1.	**Chatting with IBM Robot**: Users can interact with an IBM robot to receive tailored suggestions on sustainability across various aspects of their daily lives.
2.	**Routine Task management**: Users can complete routine tasks with customizable frequency settings.
3.	**Augmented Reality Tree Planting**: Users are encouraged to plant augmented reality trees as part of a fantastic reward mechanism. 
Plus, as a reward mechanism to increase user motivation for completing tasks, it be designed that user can plant the AR tree and get some designed badges after completing the number of tasks. Furthermore, to enhance the user experience, the web application includes an administrative system that allows for the publication of random tasks to current users, providing them with a variety of challenges and activities.
## The Client ##
### Description of the Client and the Brief ###
The client for our project is the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). As per the initial brief provided by IBM, the project's primary objective is to create an artificial intelligence system aimed at *helping students live more sustainably and make environmentally conscious choices both at university and at home.*
### Refinement and Improvement of the Original Brief ###
Throughout the development phase, we held weekly online meetings with the client, which facilitated a series of constructive feedback sessions. During these interactions, we received numerous suggestions from IBM. For instance, they recommended incorporating statistical methods to analyse the number of users utilizing this web application. Additionally, they recommended developing a colourblind mode to cater specifically to users with colour vision deficiencies, ensuring that the application is accessible and user-friendly. 

Consequently, the scope of our project's objectives was expanded beyond university students to include individuals interested in enhancing their sustainability practices.
### Interaction with the Client ###
Our group communicates with clients through two different methods
1.	**Via Email**: We send an email every week so that they can track the progress of our project’s development. Additionally, every fortnight, we send another email with a video demonstration attached, allowing them to visually observe the progress at each stage of our web application’s development.
2.	**Via Meeting**: IBM has provided us with an IT support member, and we hold online meeting every Tuesday throughout the project development period. He offers valuable methodological support and provides user-centric suggestions for improving our web application.
## Challenges ##
1. **Time plan challenges**: Our project needs to be completed within three months, which includes the development, deployment, testing, evaluation, and report writing phases. Meeting this deadline poses significant time management challenges.
2. **Methodology challenges**: We need to select an appropriate methodology for developing our web application and learn the required technologies for both the front-end and back-end development, as well as the communication between these two layers, from scratch. Furthermore, it also requires the knowledge about deployment after completing the development. This requires a high level of self-learning capacity within a short timeframe.
3. **Communication challenges**: It is crucial to carefully determine the team division of tasks, deciding which member is responsible for each part of the project. Furthermore, we need maintain frequent communication to ensure that everyone’s development work progresses stably and aligns with project objectives.
4. **Market challenges**: We face the challenge of ensuring that our target audience not only uses our web application but also finds it appealing. Additionally, we need to raise awareness of the application among those outside the immediate target group. Finally, encouraging continued use of the application presents another significant challenge.

In a word, our group is to implement our project efficiently and provide a web application designed to help university students and other individuals live more sustainably and make environmentally friendly choices. Detailed information on all these aspects will be provided in the following sections of our report.
